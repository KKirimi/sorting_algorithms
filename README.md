A sorting algorithm outs elements of a list into an order. The output is in monotonic order, and is a permutation. This learning objectives of the projects are to: (i) Comprehend at least four soring algorithms. (ii) Big O notation and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm. (iii) How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input. (iv) What a stable algorithm is.
